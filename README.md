## General info
> The motivation: The mother of all invention- necessity. I, Craig Sandlin, was required to do electrical measurements on lighting fixtures to characterize the product before approbation listing with UL and/or Intertek. The sample size for this testing was sometimes upward of 70 discrete measurements. The changes that needed to be made to the software were repetitive and regular. If only I could program the inputs ahead of time! But alas, the software was propriatery and no API was available. It is tasks like these where this software really shines. With some upfront setup the entire process could be automated. Even allowing measurements to be taken over night which improved throughput!
